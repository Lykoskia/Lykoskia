# Hi there, I'm Alan! 👋

**Web Developer | Automation Enthusiast**

I'm a self-taught developer from Croatia who discovered programming through necessity and fell in love with creating solutions that make people's work easier. What started as automating tedious tasks at my day job has evolved into a passion for building web applications that solve real problems.

## 🚀 My Journey

Currently working as a sales support specialist, I'm pursuing a full-time developer career. I've spent the last 3+ years building web applications in my free time, driven by the satisfaction of turning complex manual processes into simple, automated workflows.

**The project I'm most proud of:** Automated the generation and distribution of 7,000+ personalized PDF certificates - transforming a 3-month process requiring 5 people into a single-day task for one person. This saved thousands of euros annually and sparked my love for programming.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS  
**Backend:** Currently learning Spring Boot (Java)  
**Other:** VBA, Excel automation, SQL

**Currently exploring:** SolidJS, modern architecture patterns

## 🎯 What I'm Building

### [Business Applications](https://cowebapi.vercel.app/)
I've developed several web tools for workflow optimization:
- **Insurance Calculators** - Multiple product calculation tools
- **Report Processor** - Automatically separates uploaded excel reports
- **PDF Form Automator** - Streamlines document processing
- **Certificate Generator** - Web version of my automation system

*Currently rebuilding these with Spring Boot backend + Next.js App Router frontend*
- **[The app can be found here](https://cowebapps.vercel.app/)** - Progress: 7 out of 9 apps done, currently still working on the 2 Fleet calculators (03.08.2025.)

### Personal Projects
- **[PDF417 Barcode Generator](https://fin-apps.vercel.app/bcg)** - HUB3 standard compliant
- **[Real-time Chat App](https://nextjs-chat.up.railway.app/)** - WebSocket-powered user communication
- **[Demographics Dashboard](https://hr-vis.vercel.app/)** - Interactive data visualization
- **[Headless](https://www.elan-living.com/) [Websites](https://www.elan-homecare.com/)** - Optimized custom websites + headless CMS
- **[Modern Next.js Website](https://aquacentar.vercel.app/)** - Modern, performant custom website with PPR

## 🌱 Learning Philosophy

I believe the best way to learn is by building. Every project teaches me something new about problem-solving, architecture, or user experience. I'm not afraid to dive deep and understand how things work under the hood.

## 💭 What Drives Me

> "I'm happiest when I create a new tool that helps people do their jobs better."

I love the moment when a complex problem becomes a simple solution. Whether it's reducing a 3-month process to 1 day or building a calculator that saves hours of manual work, I'm motivated by real impact.

## 🎯 Goals

- Transition to professional software development
- Master modern full-stack architecture
- Continue building solutions that make work more efficient
- Explore new technologies like SolidJS
